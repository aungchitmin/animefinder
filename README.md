My first react project after watching Bob Ziroll's free react course. 3.4.2022

-i used only useState hook. 
-there's still a bug i didn't fix which might need useEffect to run setTimeout() function for no result message. also, i might need to seperate it as a component. will do it later..
-search by name results are limited to 25 and no load more button is provided.
-i used API v3 for search by name and v4 for by genre boxes because v4 search still not provides alternative names. Eg. Attack on titan can be typed and found in v3 but for v4 it requires japanese name.But i will update to v4 later.
